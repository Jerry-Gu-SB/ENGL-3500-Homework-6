# ENGL-3500-Homework-6

Coursework for ENGL 3500: Literary Games taught by Professors Jason Bennett (jcb2h) and Brad Pasanek (bmp7e) at the University of Virginia.  

Essentially there will be a grid in which you move around small characters in an RTS style. There will be red zones that periodically appear and will kill your units if your units do not escape the red zone in time. The tiles are modified to disturb the movement of your units (this feature might be out of scope for this class).
